# jupyter-apis-homework
 Learning how to use a Jupyter notebook

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about working with APIs and navigating through dictionaries of dictionaries of lists of dictionaries (or something like that). And learning how to name variables uniquely!

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt about .append in an earlier homework assignment, but I finally understood how it worked during this home assignment. I learnt that in a for loop, you can add a variable into a URL. *Mind blown.* I used that to solve question 9. I also learnt how to apply a code to a specific number of elements in a list while looping. I think that will come in handy in the future!

## **Something I found challenging:**
Figuring out how to hide the API key. Four different people had to explain it to me. Which was a bit tragic. I had an easier time with the actual assignment!
